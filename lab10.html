            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>
                Habitat for Humanity believes that every man, woman and child should have a
                decent, safe and affordable place to live. We build and repair houses all over
                the world using volunteer labor and donations. Our partner families purchase
                these houses through no-profit, no-interest mortgage loans or innovative
                financing methods.
            </p>
            <h2>Why We Build</h2>
            <p>
                There are nearly 2 billion people around the world who live in slum housing
                and more than 100 million are homeless. Families left homeless by natural
                disasters, war and civil unrest often face dire housing situations as they
                struggle to rebuild their lives. We provide shelter and housing assistance to
                help these families recover.
            </p>
